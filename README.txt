So uh I wanted to make an autoclicker for clicker games, (ex. My name is mayo, cookie clicker, etc), so I decided to make one in C#, but that turned out
to be a more difficult task than just making a macro and doing it that way.


You can either download the .exe that is found in the releases (I promise it's safe!) or download AHK and run it that way, however I suggest just downloading the .exe
as it's simpler and easier.


How to use this program

1. Download the .exe from the releases
2. Done! Enjoy!


Running it from AHK

1. Download AutoHotKey ( https://www.autohotkey.com/ )
2. Install
3. either git clone this repo or download the zip
4. extract the zip (skip this if you git cloned)
5. right click the file and hit run script
6. Done! Enjoy!


Features: 

control + j : spam left mouse


Escape : Exit the script
